All of the HTML files you can find in this folder are NOT minified or altered in any way.
It's raw HTML responses from the server.

We want to keep them as close to the original as possible.
Even though, minor modifications are allowed such as modifying some texts to prevent revealing any sensitive information about the users we logged in with. 

These are here for testing purposes only, you can see how they're used in `*.test.ts` files, mostly in the [`src/decoders`](/src/decoders/) folder.
